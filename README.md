## File Structure

The code in this repository is structured into two main parts:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ contracts # The smart contracts
â””â”€â”€ ui        # The user interface (UI) for interacting with the smart contracts
```

## Run the UI locally

See [ui/README.md](ui/README.md)

## Testing against the Goerli Ethereum testnet

Add Goerli testnet variables to your local development environment:
```
cp .env.sepolia .env.local
```

Start the development server:
```
yarn dev
```

Once you go to http://localhost:42069, you will see the message "uses Goerli as its preferred network":

Solve this by switching to the _Sepolia Test Network_ in MetaMask:

## Run the smart contracts locally

Follow the instructions at [`contracts/README.md#local-setup`](https://github.com/nation3/app/blob/main/contracts/README.md#local-setup).

Update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN` variable in `.env.local` to match your local Ethereum [node](https://github.com/nation3/app/blob/main/contracts/README.md#running-a-node).

Start the development server:
```
yarn dev
```
